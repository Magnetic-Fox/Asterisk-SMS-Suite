# Asterisk SMS Suite

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools for processing and controlling the flow of short messages of different types in the Asterisk PBX.
This suite can correctly route SMS-es and SIP instant messages and also resend them as a fax or voice messages to the non-messaging channels making it a ready-to-use solution for instant messaging of any kind.

## Important notes

This set of tools was created for SIP-configured Asterisk working on Linux system (especially Debian).
It should work with PJSIP configurations, but I haven't tested it (it's yet to be done in my configuration).
These tools might need some kind of fine tuning to work with PJSIP configurations properly.

Default configuration values (provided in configuration scripts and `sms-process.sh`) assume that Asterisk and its directories are located in their default locations (`/etc/asterisk`, `/var/spool/asterisk`, etc.) and that there is a dedicated directory for all scripts at `/etc/asterisk/scripts`.

**This solution was created for Asterisk 16.28.** However it should work with the newer versions.
I haven't tested if these tools can work properly on systems other than Linux.

## Differences between SMS technology and SIP messaging

People often confuse SMS technology with SIP instant messaging. **They are different protocols!**
SMS requires some kind of a central point (also called SMS Centre/SMS Centrum) which acts like a server which receive, store, process and resend Your messages (and, ideally, should keep Your messages for some time if the receiving end is offline).
SIP messaging is much more automated and then looks more like a point-to-point service. It doesn't explicitly use such a thing like a SMS Centre. **But it also doesn't mean Asterisk server have nothing to do here.** However, this technology is less powerful than classic SMS service.

And, the most important thing - SMS Centre actually **can** work even on the classic landline technology (POTS) using FSK modulation (which is, in my opinion, such a great thing that it really works in Asterisk!) allowing You to use old analogue telephone with SMS support.
In contrast, **SIP messages can't** as they are protocol based. I know no VoIP ATA that could turn this into the FSK SMS or something similar. There are probably IP phones supporting SIP messaging, but I don't know of any. The only ones I know and have used are software SIP clients like MicroSIP or Zoiper (both really good).

## Database with chosen messaging services

As this solution was prepared to be able to resend messages as faxes or voice calls, it needs to know what kind of service the recipient has activated.
For this to work, it needs to have a simple table in a database with information about chosen service, phone number and Asterisk extension.
There are at least three columns needed:

* Account -> varchar(100) - phone number
* Message -> varchar(1) - character indicating chosen service
* Extension -> varchar(100) - Asterisk extension (e.g. SIP/1000)

`getChanInfo.py` was prepared to utilize MySQL database (using MySQL connector). If You need to use other database system, You have to change it in this script.

## Service indicators

I've defined six indicators for services:

* S - normal SMS operation (SMS Centre)
* F - send message as a fax
* V - send message as a voice (make a voice call with text synthesis)
* C - simple command service (automated SMS reciver and answerer)
* T - SIP messaging operation
* N - no messaging at all (disable messaging feature for the chosen number)

## Dependencies

These tools need some other packages and libraries to work.
Here is the list (hope I remember everything):

1. Asterisk (of course)
2. smsq (should be part of the Asterisk package)
3. pyst2 (Python Asterisk helper)
4. Pillow (PIL)
5. gTTS (simple Python voice synthesis helper utilizing Google Translate, as far as I know)
6. paps
7. ghostscript (gs)
8. Imagemagick (convert)
9. libtiff-tools (tiffset)

## Default (and additional) directories

Default configurations provided here assume that Asterisk and other tools are in the specific locations.
Here is the list:

1. `/etc/asterisk` - main configuration directory for Asterisk
2. `/etc/asterisk/scripts` - **additional** directory for all scripts from this suite
3. `/var/spool/asterisk` - spool directory for Asterisk
4. `/var/spool/asterisk/sms` - SMS part of Asterisk's spool directory
5. `/var/spool/asterisk/sms/morx` - directory for received SMS-es
6. `/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing` - directory for `.call` files (originating calls)
7. `/var/spool/T.38` - **additional** directory for faxes (don't have to be T.38 - I've used such name, because T.38 was first way of faxing in Asterisk I used; now I'm using audio stream but the name stayed the same ;))
8. `/var/spool/T.38/outgoing` - **additional** directory for TIFFs to be sent
9. `/var/spool/Voice` - **additional** directory for voice files
10. `/var/spool/Voice/outgoing` - **additional** directory for voice files to be played on call

Additional above means that those directories didn't exist previously in the installation.
They were created by me to make performing additional functions easier.
They are now **used and necessary** in this software (`scripts` in the configurations, `T.38` and `Voice` in spool).

## Tools, in brief

The main functionality is provided by `extensions.conf` file and `sms-process.sh` script.
Extensions file defines all needed extensions and some basic operations (I've uploaded part of mine describing how to use my tools) and the Bash script processes all SMS-es previously received by SMS Centre.
All other Python scripts are used to get information about channel and chosen service, to prepare other type of message (fax, voice synthesis, etc.) or to post SIP message, etc.
There is also one auxiliary script called `cutter.py` which is used to automatically cut prepared fax page to help waste less paper on the receiving fax machine.

1. `extensions.conf` - main part of the job, which still is in the Asterisk's extensions configuration
2. `sms-process.sh` - main SMS processor/router (also have some configuration variables inside, probably to be changed before use!)
3. `getChanInfo.py` - helper for gathering number information (chosen service, channel extension, etc.)
4. `smsToFax.py` - fax page and call creator
5. `smsToVoice.py` - voice synthesis and call creator
6. `smsCommand.py` - SMS commands processor (just an example to be extended to be something better)
7. `cutter.py` - cutting helper for making fax pages shorter (from [Mail2Fax](https://github.com/Magnetic-Fox/Mail2Fax) project)
8. `agiGetChanInfo.py` - AGI wrapper for `getChanInfo.py`
9. `agiPostSMS.py` - AGI tool for posting SMS-es like they were received by SMS Centre
10. `amiSendSIPIM.py` - AMI tool for sending SIP instant messages
11. `smsSuiteConfig.py` - simple configuration script for most of the tools
12. `sqlConfig.py` - simple configuration for SQL credentials
13. `amiConfig.py` - simple configuration for AMI credentials
14. `concatenatedSMSSender.py` - helper for sending concatenated SMS-es (for messages longer than 160 characters)

In fact, only `sms-process.sh`, `agiGetChanInfo.py` and `agiPostSMS.py` are explicitly seen as used (in `extensions.conf`).
Use of other tools is automated (seen in `sms-process.sh` or other scripts).

## Disclaimer

I've made much effort to provide here working code and solutions with hope they'll be useful and free from any bugs.
However I can't guarantee anything. The software and solutions here are provided "AS IS" and **I take no responsibility for anything. You're using them on Your own risk!**

## License

Free for personal use. You probably shouldn't use these solutions commercially (as they are not so good tested to be intended to).
However, if You still like to anyway, please ask me before.
